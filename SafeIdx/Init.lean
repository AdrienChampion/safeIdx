section fuid

/-- A uid with an upper-bound, coerces to its `Uid` type parameter.

This type is a generalized version of Lean core's `Fin`. Unlike `Fin` which specifies that a `Nat`
(often seen as an array-index) is strictly smaller than some value `n` (`Fin n`), `FUid` is
parameterized by the index type in addition to the `Nat` upper-bound: `Fin Uid n`.

The actual upper-bound is a `Nat` and not a `Uid`-value since it will correspond to the length of
an array, just like `Fin`. Since we don't want to create `Uid` values that are not legal indices
for the array they come from, it would be bad form to have the upper-bound be a `Uid` that's not
legal for that array since it corresponds to its length.
